# Genetic Algorithm and machine leaning algorithm for Enhancing Intrusion Detection System

## This is the repo for decision tree classifier optimization using genetic algorithm
Decision tree is one of the most used algorithm for IDS. The best performing model is Random forest which is am ensemble approach that combines many decision trees and pick best amongst them to find the best accuracy for threat detection.
